# PSAsk

Powershell interface to OpenRouter, translated from [kagisearch/ask](https://github.com/kagisearch/ask). If you are looking for a bash version of this, just go there.

## Install

Add your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your environment.

Run with `.\ask.ps1`.

Create an alias in `$PROFILE`:

```
Set-Alias ask `$PATH_TO\ask.ps1`
```
